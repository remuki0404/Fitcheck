I’m excited to share my new project — FitCheck 👕✨

FitCheck is a simple fashion-focused application that helps users visually check outfit combinations and overall appearance. 
This project is designed without any body measurement or content measurement features and focuses purely on style, fit, and presentation.

Key highlights of FitCheck:
• Outfit and appearance preview concept
• Clean and minimal UI flow
• Easy-to-use fashion check experience
• Focus on visual fit, not measurements

This project was created to explore UI/UX thinking and product flow design for lifestyle and fashion-based applications.

I’d be happy to receive feedback and suggestions!
