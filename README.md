 👗FitCheck – Contactless Outfit & Body Measurement App

Project Overview

FitCheck is a contactless fashion and body-measurement assistance application developed during my internship.
The core objective of this app is to help users measure body dimensions and check outfit fit using a webcam, without any physical contact or manual measurements.

The application is designed to provide a modern, safe, and user-friendly experience, focusing on convenience and accessibility.
